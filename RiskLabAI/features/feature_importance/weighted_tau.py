    Calculate the weighted Kendall's tau (τ) using feature importances and principal component ranks.

    Kendall's tau is a measure of correlation between two rankings. The weighted version of
    Kendall's tau takes into account the weights of the rankings. In this case, the weights
    are the inverse of the principal component ranks.
